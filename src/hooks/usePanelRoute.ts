/**
 * Keeps the address bar and the open tool in step.
 *
 * Every tool now has an address — `#umwandeln`, `#tonart`, `#spuren-trennen` —
 * so a tab can be linked to, bookmarked, sent to somebody, and reached again
 * with the back button. Before this the whole app lived at one URL and the
 * back button left the site.
 *
 * The hash, not a path: `vercel.json` carries no catch-all rewrite, so
 * `/umwandeln` would be a real 404 on reload, and adding one risks shadowing
 * the two functions under `api/`. A fragment needs nothing from the server and
 * cannot break them.
 *
 * It stays out of the way of the share target, which arrives at `?shared=n`
 * and clears that marker once the files are collected.
